I have been thinking about privacy issues in social media for a while,

I came with a solution ( personal growth based social media ) that allow content consumers to consume content with personalied recomendation system
where we dont track nore store there info, infact they ( consumer ) will stay unkown by not even creating account.

users don't have to explisitly choose intrested topics, 

while showing target ads as well.

please connect with me, I just need a chat with you.
